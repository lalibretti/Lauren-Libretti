#Lauren Libretti Portfolio Site 
##A portfolio site for Lauren to feature both web development work and lighting design work. 

    - Functionality features easy to find information to see examples of Lauren's previous work, links to other pages on social media & communities, and ways to get in conact with her. 

    - Utilizes .html, .css, bootstrap, and javascript.

    ##Future Improvement
    -I'd like to update the web development page to have images to work and written descriptions about each project.
    -Update the photos on the index page, and the lx page. 
    - Have a list of languages I'm proficient in on web dev page, in column form
    -I have seen portfolio pages that are long form in one page, the header & nav bar are sticky and link to different portions of the page. I'd consider merging into one page as this seems to be a popular portfolio design. 
    -Reformat the carousel on the lighting page, the visual design is not quite what I'd like. I'd like an overall smaller image to allow for more text without the need to scroll or resize.
    -The contact page needs more information. I'm considering adding a compliment generator, people get an automoated compliment when they submit the form. I resisted the urge to add it for this project, I've done it on codepen for fun.
