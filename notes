            <p>Like many people at the beginning of quarantine, I tried making sourdough. After burning my first loaf, I
                decided to swap out my cooking apron and learn to code. I started by self-learning and as I gained more
                skills I realized this was something I wanted to pursue more than a hobby. I wanted more formal training
                and enrolled in a bootcamp. Iâ€™m looking to continue learning and gain new skills in a professional
                environment. I think my passion for coding comes from my experience as a lighting designer, I was using
                technology to create something aesthetically pleasing and functional. I receive the same excitement and
                pride when I deploy my code as when I see one of my designs on stage. I hope to continue my coding
                journey in a community to help myself and others grow while working on real challenges. As a creative
                thinkerand maker I'm extied to create functional things that are aesthetically pleasing. You can see
                that reflected in my work as a lighting designer and developer.
